DISCLAIMER:
  This is free software. It comes with no guarentees and I take no responsiblity if it makes your computer explode or opens a portal to the demon dimensions, or does anything.

INSTALL:
After unpacking the tar-ball:
    tar -zxf daytime-0.1.tar.gz

Do the usual './configure; make; make install'
    cd daytime-1.0
    ./configure
    make
    make install


USAGE:

daytime [-daytime|-time|-nist|-http <server>] [-s] [-r] [-tz <timezone>] [-p <port>]
	-daytime		Get time from daytime (RFC-867, port 13) server
	-time		Get time from time (RFC-868, port 123) server
	-nist		Get time from NIST daytime server
	-sntp		Get time from an NTP server 
	-sntp-bcast	Broadcast SNTP packets to '<server>'.
	-http		Get time from a web server (default)
	-s		Set clock to time we got from server
	-r		Set hardware RTC clock (only works on linux I suspect)
	-p		Port to connect to on server
	-tz		Timezone of server
	-servers	List of some servers to try
	-?		This help

If no server specified, time-a.nist.gov will be tried first, then http time from www.google.com

	'-sntp-bcast' doesn't get the time, it sends it. It sends sntp packets that are only accurate to a second to the address supplied as 'server'. This is usually used to update devices on a local network to a single time. 

EXAMPLES:
	daytime -daytime www.demon.co.uk -s
	daytime www.google.co.uk
	daytime -time time-a.nist.gov -s
	daytime -nist time-a.nist.gov -s -r
	daytime -http www.google.co.uk
